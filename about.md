I am an IBM Software Engineer developing full-stack cloud native Watson applications such as [IBM Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/watson/ai-assistant/).

I studied Computer Science (Games Technology) at Nottingham Trent University.

I specialise in front-end development, using React and Angular, using modern ES6+ with Flow or Typescript. I deploy using Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry onto IBM Cloud (formerly Bluemix). I have worked in small and large teams, locally and accross the world. I love bringing code and AI to young minds through Code Clube and [Machine Learning for kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk). I love coding and learning new technologies!

In my spare time I love video games, TV, movies, badminton, snooker, and spending time with my friends and family
