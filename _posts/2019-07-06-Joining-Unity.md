![Me at IBM]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/andy_ibm.jpeg)

After over 1 year University placement and almost 10 years employed at IBM, I have taken the difficult decision to leave behind the [Big Blue](www.ibm.com) and join [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com) working in the [Multiplay division](https://multiplay.com)!

At Multiplay, the worlds leading platform for video game servers, I'll be working on a modern front-end for a world-class hybrid cloud platform in a very exciting industry that I've been wanting to always be a part of: video gaming. This company is the perfect blend of gaming and enterprise, which is exactly where my skillset lies.

Multiplay are amazing at what they do. [They were crucial to the launch of Apex Legends](https://multiplay.com/2019/04/30/launching-the-fastest-growing-battle-royale-of-all-time-apex-legends/). I am extremely excited to join such a high performing company.

I will be sad to leave behind everyone at IBM, but I've gained a huge amount of valuable skills, both in technology and in personal, and in fact it's because they've equipped me with all I need am I even able to make this leap.

So here is to the end of an era, and the start of something exciting.
