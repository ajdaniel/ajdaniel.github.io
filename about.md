:wave: hey, I'm Andrew James Daniel.

### Where I work

I am a full-stack Software Engineer. I work at [Multiplay](https://multiplay.com) (part of [Unity](https://unity.com)) developing great software to support video game developers and publishers.

Previously, I was an IBM Software Engineer developing full-stack cloud native enterprise applications such as [IBM Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/watson/ai-assistant/), [IBM Watson Compare & Comply](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compare-and-comply), [IBM API Connect](https://cloud.ibm.com/apis/overview) and [IBM i2 IAP](https://www.ibm.com/security/intelligence-analysis/i2).

### My Skills and experiences

I specialise in front-end development, using React and Angular, using modern ES6+ with Flow or Typescript, using Redux and/or GraphQL, connecting to databases like Cloudant (CouchDB) or Mongo. I deploy using Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry onto IBM Cloud (formerly Bluemix). I have worked in small and large teams, locally and across the world. I love learning and teaching all technologies.

I love bringing code and AI to young minds through [Code Club](https://codeclub.org/) and [Machine Learning for kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk), or corporate events like IBM Call for Code.

### My life

I studied Computer Science (Games Technology) at Nottingham Trent University in the UK and graduated in 2009.

This year I got married to the love of my life. I love spending time with her or my family. I love gaming, TV and movies along with playing Badminton and Snooker.
